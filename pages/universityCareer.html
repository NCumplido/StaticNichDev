        <h2>Bachelors</h2> <!-- Item two-->

        <p id="bachelorsIntroduction">
        Before my masters year, I did my bachelors degree, also at Swansea university. 
        The modules that I took throughout the three years included: functional programming, automata and formal language theory, 
        data visualisation, concepts of computer science and professional issues, just to name a few.

        Although some modules and assignments I dragged myself through, or adored, I deeply respect each of them. 
        These modules were taught by people who are immensely experienced in the subject.
        Either the lecturers have professional experience from industry in that subject, or have PhDs and conducting research in the subject.
        </p>
        
        <ul>Listed below are modules that I took, thoroughly enjoyed and/or exceled at in my bachelor years:
            <br>
            <u>Third year:</u>
                <li>UX</li>
                <li>Web application development( <a href="https://github.com/NCumplido/Year-3-web-apps-.NetCore">.NetCore)</a></li>
                <li>Writing mobile apps</li>
                <br />
                <u>Second year:</u>
                <li>Human computer interaction</li>
                <li>Software engineering</li>
                <li>Computer graphics</li>
